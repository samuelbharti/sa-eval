### Problem Statement
Researchers are interested in a disease affecting the kidneys. They have identified the top 25 significantly up-regulated genes (list below). They want you to identify the most important gene ontology (GO) terms related to biological processes (BP) that are enriched in this gene list. Use [Enrichr](https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/) to identify enriched BP GO terms. The researchers want you to return a list of the most important terms. They define important terms as being both significantly enriched and relevant to disease.
